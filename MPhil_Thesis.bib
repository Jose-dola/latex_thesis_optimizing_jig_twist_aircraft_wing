  abstract = {Kernel methods are among the most popular techniques in machine learning. From a regularization perspective they play a central role in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a probabilistic perspective they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is known as the covariance function. Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning. In this paper, we review different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic and functional methods.},

Evolutionary algorithms are considered as modified and generalized classical genetic algorithms in which populations of chromosomes are coded by floating point representation, and the new modified crossover and mutation operations are introduced. The evolutionary algorithm starts with a population of randomly generated chromosomes from a feasible solution domain. These chromosomes, which have the vector structure, evolve toward better solutions by applying genetic operators such as selection, mutation, and crossover. After applying genetic operators, the new population has a better fitness. The probability of crossover and mutation does not have to be constant as in classical genetic algorithms and it can change during the evolutionary process. An objective function (fitness function) with constraints plays the role of the environment to distinguish between good and bad chromosomes and to select the better solution.},

  abstract = {Off-the-shelf Gaussian Process (GP) covariance functions encode smoothness assumptions on the structure of the function to be modeled. To model complex and nondifferentiable functions, these smoothness assumptions are often too restrictive. One way to alleviate this limitation is to find a different representation of the data by introducing a feature space. This feature space is often learned in an unsupervised way, which might lead to data representations that are not useful for the overall regression task. In this paper, we propose Manifold Gaussian Processes, a novel supervised method that jointly learns a transformation of the data into a feature space and a GP regression from the feature space to observed space. The Manifold GP is a full GP and allows to learn data representations, which are useful for the overall regression task. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our approach on complex non-smooth functions where standard GPs perform poorly, such as step functions and robotics tasks with contacts.},

One of the key issues in such studies is to get information about the output when the numerical simulations are expensive to run. This paper considers the problem of exploring the whole space of variations of the computer model input variables in the context of a large dimensional exploration space. Various properties of space filling designs are justified: interpoint-distance, discrepancy, minimum spanning tree criteria. A specific class of design, the optimized Latin Hypercube Sample, is considered. Several optimization algorithms, coming from the literature, are studied in terms of convergence speed, robustness to subprojection and space filling properties of the resulting design. Some recommendations for building such designs are given. Finally, another contribution of this paper is the deep analysis of the space filling properties of the design 2D-subprojections.},

Moreover, deterministic (!) versions of the new heuristic turn out to perform nearly equally well, consuming only a fraction of the computing time of the stochastic versions. As an example, the deterministic threshold accepting method yields very-near-to-optimum tours for the famous 442-cities traveling salesman problem of Gr\"otschel within 1 to 2 s of CPU time.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions. They have been applied to both regression and non-linear dimensionality reduction, and offer desirable properties such as uncertainty estimates, robustness to over-fitting, and principled ways for tuning hyper-parameters. However the scalability of these models to big datasets remains an active topic of research. We introduce a novel re-parametrisation of variational inference for sparse GP regression and latent variable models that allows for an efficient distributed algorithm. This is done by exploiting the decoupling of the data given the inducing points to re-formulate the evidence lower bound in a Map-Reduce setting. We show that the inference scales well with data and computational resources, while preserving a balanced distribution of the load among the nodes. We further demonstrate the utility in scaling Gaussian processes to big data. We show that GP performance improves with increasing amounts of data in regression (on flight data with 2 million records) and latent variable modelling (on MNIST). The results show that GPs perform better than many common models often used for big data.},

  abstract = {Simulated annealing is a popular local search meta-heuristic used to address discrete and, to a lesser extent, continuous optimization problems. The key feature of simulated annealing is that it provides a means to escape local optima by allowing hill-climbing moves (i.e., moves which worsen the objective function value) in hopes of finding a global optimum. A brief history of simulated annealing is presented, including a review of its application to discrete and continuous optimization problems. Convergence theory for simulated annealing is reviewed, as well as recent advances in the analysis of finite time performance. Other local search algorithms are discussed in terms of their relationship to simulated annealing. The chapter also presents practical guidelines for the implementation of simulated annealing in terms of cooling schedules, neighborhood functions, and appropriate applications.},

  abstract = {Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), as an efficient sampling method, has been widely used in computer experiments. But it is difficult to choice the sample size while applying LHS, especially for expensive simulations. The effective way is to add sample points sequentially. Nevertheless, the oversampling problem may be countered while extending the sample size with the existing extension algorithms of LHS. To alleviate this problem and obtain extension sample with good space-filling properties, a novel extension algorithm of optimized LHS (OLHS) is proposed. According to the extending rule, a new LHS is constructed by adding sample points of size n each time firstly. Then each additional sample points are optimized by the enhanced stochastic evolutionary algorithm based on the CL2 space-filling criterion. The extension algorithm is illustrated by two test functions and appears to perform well in both efficiency and convergence compared with the traditional extension algorithm.},

  abstract = {The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process regression (GPR), a well-known nonparametric, and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. However, they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this article is devoted to reviewing state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations that distillate the entire data and local approximations that divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations that modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations that retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations that exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

Their sampling distribution theory depends heavily on the isotropic case and some developments are discussed. An optimum property of an important test for the von Mises\textendash Fisher case is established. A non-parametric test is proposed for the hypothesis of independence for observations on a torus. In addition to some numerical examples on the preceding topics, five case studies are given which illuminate the power of this new methodology. The case studies are concerned with cancer research, origins of comets, arrival times of patients, navigational problems and biological rhythms. Some unsolved problems are also indicated.},

In this setting, we derive the form of the minimal norm interpolant to a finite set of data and apply it to study some regularization functionals which are important in learning theory.

  abstract = {A Hilbert space embedding of a distribution---in short, a kernel mean embedding---has recently emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning and inference. The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel methods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a generalization of the original "feature map" common to support vector machines (SVMs) and other kernel methods. While initially closely associated with the latter, it has meanwhile found application in fields ranging from kernel machines and probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery, and deep learning. The goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of existing work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss the most challenging issues and open problems that could lead to new research directions. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and positive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by a thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions, theoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of distributions enables us to apply RKHS methods to probability measures which prompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing, independent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the Hilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical insights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables us to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous in graphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in a non-parametric way. We then discuss relationships between this framework and other related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research directions.},

This paper uses a probability-space surrogate as opposed to an algebraic surrogate so that the probability distributions of the required outputs at a given design input can naturally be obtained without repeated Monte Carlo runs of an algebraic surrogate at different realizations of the uncertain variables. We consider three probability-space surrogates with analytical solutions for prediction and inference - Multivariate Gaussian, Gaussian Copula, and Gaussian Mixture Model, and investigate their applicability to perform multidisciplinary design optimization under uncertainty. All the input design and random variables, coupling variables, objective and constraint functions are incorporated within the probability-space surrogate, which helps analytically obtain the distributions of coupling variables, objective and constraint functions at desired design inputs while enforcing multidisciplinary compatibility. The training points for the probability-space surrogates are obtained by performing one-pass analysis through the disciplinary models at different realizations of the input variables. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) and reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO) in an aircraft design example. The performance of the probability-space surrogates is compared against a Kriging algebraic surrogate and fully coupled Monte Carlo analysis.},

If the reader has previously studied these prerequisites, then one can rapidly move to the inverse problems in chapters 4-8 on image restoration, thermal radiation, thermal characterization and heat transfer.``This text does provide a comprehensive introduction to inverse problems and fills a void in the literature''.Robert E White, Professor of Mathematics, North Carolina State University},

Asymptotic arguments and numerical simulations are used to show that the generalized cross-validatory procedure preforms well from the point of view of a weighted mean squared error criterion. The methodology adds to the battery of graphical tools for model building and checking within the generalized linear model framework. Included are two examples motivated by medical and horticultural applications.},

When P(B) = 0, the ratio formula breaks down. The Borel\textendash Kolmogorov paradox suggests that conditional probabilities in such cases are indeterminate or ill-posed. To analyze the paradox, I explore the relation between probability and intensionality. I argue that the paradox is a Frege case, similar to those that arise in many probabilistic and non-probabilistic contexts. The paradox vividly illustrates how an agent's way of representing an entity can rationally influence her credal assignments. I deploy my analysis to defend Kolmogorov's relativistic treatment of conditional probability.},

For a {$\in$} B, its distance to the ball of {$\mathscr{H}$} with radius R (denoted as I(a, R)) tends to zero when R tends to infinity. We are interested in the rate of this convergence. This approximation problem arose from the study of learning theory, where B is the L               2               space and {$\mathscr{H}$} is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.                                         The class of elements having I(a, R) = O(R               -r               ) with r {$>$} 0 is an interpolation space of the couple (B, {$\mathscr{H}$}). The rate of convergence can often be realized by linear operators. In particular, this is the case when {$\mathscr{H}$} is the range of a compact, symmetric, and strictly positive definite linear operator on a separable Hilbert space B. For the kernel approximation studied in Learning Theory, the rate depends on the regularity of the kernel function. This yields error estimates for the approximation by reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. When the kernel is smooth, the convergence is slow and a logarithmic convergence rate is presented for analytic kernels in this paper. The purpose of our results is to provide some theoretical estimates, including the constants, for the approximation error required for the learning theory.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic design in complex design spaces is often a computationally expensive and difficult task because of the highly nonlinear and noisy nature of those spaces. Approximate probabilistic methods, such as, First-Order Second-Moments (FOSM) and Point Estimate Method (PEM) have been developed to alleviate the high computational cost issue. However, both methods have difficulty with non-monotonic spaces and FOSM may have convergence problems if noise on the space makes it difficult to calculate accurate numerical partial derivatives. Use of design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) methods to build polynomial meta-models is a common approach which both smoothes the design space and significantly improves the computational efficiency. However, this type of model is inherently limited by the properties of the polynomial function and its transformations. Therefore, polynomial meta-models may not accurately represent the portion of the design space that is of interest to the engineer. The objective of this paper is to utilize Gaussian Process (GP) techniques to build an alternative meta-model that retains the properties of smoothness and fast execution but has a much higher level of accuracy. If available, this high quality GP model can then be used for fast probabilistic analysis based on a function that much more closely represents the original design space. Achieving the GP goal of a highly accurate meta-model requires a level of mathematics that is much more complex than the mathematics required for regular linear and quadratic response surfaces. Many difficult mathematical issues encountered in the implementation of the Gaussian Process meta-model are addressed in this paper. Several selected examples demonstrate the accuracy of the GP models and efficiency improvements related to probabilistic design.},

  abstract = {An accessible introduction to metaheuristics and optimization, featuring powerful and modern algorithms for application across engineering and the sciences From engineering and computer science to economics and management science, optimization is a core component for problem solving. Highlighting the latest developments that have evolved in recent years, Engineering Optimization: An Introduction with Metaheuristic Applications outlines popular metaheuristic algorithms and equips readers with the skills needed to apply these techniques to their own optimization problems. With insightful examples from various fields of study, the author highlights key concepts and techniques for the successful application of commonly-used metaheuristc algorithms, including simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, harmony search, and genetic algorithms. The author introduces all major metaheuristic algorithms and their applications in optimization through a presentation that is organized into three succinct parts:  Foundations of Optimization and Algorithms provides a brief introduction to the underlying nature of optimization and the common approaches to optimization problems, random number generation, the Monte Carlo method, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo method Metaheuristic Algorithms presents common metaheuristic algorithms in detail, including genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, ant algorithms, bee algorithms, particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithms, and harmony search Applications outlines a wide range of applications that use metaheuristic algorithms to solve challenging optimization problems with detailed implementation while also introducing various modifications used for multi-objective optimization  Throughout the book, the author presents worked-out examples and real-world applications that illustrate the modern relevance of the topic. A detailed appendix features important and popular algorithms using MATLAB\textregistered{} and Octave software packages, and a related FTP site houses MATLAB code and programs for easy implementation of the discussed techniques. In addition, references to the current literature enable readers to investigate individual algorithms and methods in greater detail. Engineering Optimization: An Introduction with Metaheuristic Applications is an excellent book for courses on optimization and computer simulation at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners working in the fields of mathematics, engineering, computer science, operations research, and management science who use metaheuristic algorithms to solve problems in their everyday work.},
